    t1:
      block: ' the owner is the CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORG. M0F0 thinks that the ORG3 is
        the owner. [in terms of acquisition or disposition] the [ORG3] is kind of
        the owner. you, too, were thinking that CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORG is the owner;
        more along the lines of me. [M0F0] is pretty knowledgeable on these types
        of things. So he is looking at the ORG3 being the owner because they sort
        of give the lease over [, hand receipt the property]; they grant it. [E0C1
        qualified that a little by noting that ORG3 manages "ground", land property.
        The ORG3 would manage the overall land use but not necessarily the buildings].
        If you really want to talk about who acts as the owner, then that would be
        the CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORG. let us think about it, he is the one that gets the
        money. [in terms of my own rental properties] we are the guys that. we are
        the owners, we have a management company, we have tenants, and I am the facility
        manager, too. I''m the guy out there mowing the lawn. So, I''m the facility
        manager and the laborer. So what I''m thinking out loud is that the owner
        is the person with the checkbook. does that make sense? '
      topic: the "owner"
    t10:
      block: ' is important. [economics] is a huge driver. the TOP_MANAGEMENT money
        can be a little stove piped, too. we may have money that pays utility bills
        and money that pays the maintenance bill, [but] they are separate. so you
        [me] might not be able to [share them]. If I were an owner, in town, of a
        rental property, it is all one checkbook. so I know if I have enough money
        in the checkbook to install energy efficient equipment. I''m not the guy who
        is pay the utility bill [on PLACE1], but if I''m going to do something to
        improve my properties that would give a payback in terms of rental income,
        it may be a 5-year payback. but I can do that [rental property] because I
        have that control [of the funds]. Here [on PLACE1] with stove piped money
        because we only have so much [money] for maintenance, we may not spend that
        money for more energy efficient [equipment] because we are not paying the
        electric bill. I could not buy [a 6-million dollar chiller at half the energy
        use], even if it had a 2-year payback. so what you|we do, because the money
        is stove piped. you|we go back to M0F0 and say, "hey, this chiller is going
        to need replacement 2 years from now so why don''t you go back up to the guys
        that are holding the purse strings and convince them to send X-million dollars
        to buy this, so we can get the better one", because they are going to get
        the energy savings. [there is some cross-leveling of funds] at a higher level.
        I think that is probably done with good reason because if you sent all of
        the maintenance money and utility money down to one guy, then we may just
        pay the utility bill and screw (ignore) the maintenance. because it is easier
        [, the maintenance is a hard effort]. it is easier not to worry about [it]. '
      topic: payback and first cost economics
    t11:
      block: ' there can be [aggravation]. but it is pretty minor really. when it
        comes to choosing better stuff, if you can afford it, you are going to do
        it. it is just the right thing to do . [if] it (EE purchasing) fails in line
        with our goals and objectives. I think it gets to be a bigger deal when you|we
        are looking at bigger projects, bigger replacements. because the money is
        just not there [available] to do it. [going outside the maintenance "checkbook"]
        an example, at [PLACE8] a centralized chiller plant, and the hydraulic drives
        for our main chilled water pumps are failing, so we made a decision a couple
        of years ago to fund replacement. so we had a choice, you|we could get eddy-current
        drives, which would probably save a lot of money, EE wise; or you|we could
        go back [replace] with what you|we got; or something different that would
        be cheaper. and so the decision making process was pretty simple, you|we just
        look at the payback on the extra cost. if the extra costs looks like the payback
        is 3-years. it is a major capital expense. I''m going to spend 300-thousand
        more on these drives but I know I''m going to get that back in 3-years. and
        that is going to last for another 20-years. so it becomes a financial no-brainer,
        if you got the money. theoretically spending those extra 300-thousand extra
        bucks means that something further down on the cut line does not get done.
        so you look at what is on that cut line and do you want that more than this
        300-thousand extra bucks. normally, the answer is that it makes sense to spend
        the extra [money] 300-thousand extra bucks. [decisions above or below the
        cut line] the decision very much involves the end user, the owner, the property
        management guys, that is our real property planning board process. we have
        that cut list [merit list], we adjust it based on feedback; we take our best
        shot at it, with ORG2 first, with our director (C0T1), engineering chief (R0C0),
        myself, and our [installation utilization manager]. and our project managers
        who kind of represent the tenants. we take our best shot at it and then we
        take it to the owner, the CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORG, and the tenants for their
        input. and that cut list gets affected [by their input]. what is interesting
        is that they don''t know that that drive replacement could have been 300-thousand
        less and they could have a running track. they are not that savvy [about the
        process]. The tradeoff points of the EE decision are not exposed to the end
        user and owner. they could question the cost of the drive replacement. they
        are allowed to do that. it is going to cost 1pt5-million bucks, "hey, is there
        a cheaper way to do that"? Ok, then, we can talk about [the components of
        the cost] but normally we don''t see questions like that. '

    t12:
      block: ' [the stakeholders are involved,] very much so. but [order-of-merit
        list decision making] works pretty well. I would say it works better now than
        it did 6-years ago. I think our team here is. we have a good team. so I think
        the personalities involved [work well together].  '

        and it usually happens on things they [the operation groups] can pay for.
        they cannot buy a new roof [, not allowed]. the rules say you cannot use your
        [business operation] dollars to buy a roof. the TOP_MANAGEMENT stovepipes
        that money for a reason. so you are not shortchanging [critial tasks] to fix
        up your building, and you are not shortchanging your building maintenance
        to [meet your business goals]. but programmed, but there are gray areas; a
        gray area for us is usually [training and development activities], like a
        [fitness] track, for instance. [that] could be real [estate improvement],
        fixing it up could be my bill. but you could easily argue that you have a
        change in the standard of how you get someone physically fit and that is a
        TOP_MANAGEMENT [special] expense. so you can get some discretion there [for
        the change]. I will get involved in [M&R] dollars. we will have repairs that
        are discretionary or gray areas. I will approach the tenant, the [business
        operating group], and I will say "I would love to fix that for you but right
        now under [sequestration, budget shortfalls] we are short of money so this
        one [project] qualifies for your monies. Do you want to do that or not"? If
        the answer is no, they don''t want to do it, then thanks [but it may not be
        funded]. rarely is energy [consumption] a point of discussion because those
        dollars are a gray area that tends to be, [training and development related],
        things like that. It would not [be building systems]. let us say they wanted
        to renovate a classroom so that it had projectors and things that would. computers,
        that would help them do their training. very legitimate operational expense.
        we might put in energy efficient lighting as a part of doing that renovation.
        but that tenant, frankly they are not savvy enough to even want to get involved
        in that decision making . They might fuss about the cost but I''m hard press
        to imagine (believe) that, you know, if we thought something had to go in
        that was mandated to meet energy goals then that one [available option] would
        not be on the table to discuss. it is "hey, you are not going to have carpet
        in here, we are going to paint the floor. Ok"? you can see that there are
        real practical applications, really happening. '

        energy discussions] in it. but, their communication is, when it comes to energy
        and EE and energy projects and energy performance saving contracts, all goes

        M0F0 projects, to save energy. you|we are fully engaged from beginning to
        end. you|we might be engaged in coming up with the project ideas, or giving
        comments on those ideas. Yes, [M0F0 solicits me] for ideas. He will say "hey,
        here is my list of ideas to save energy. Do you see anything there that we
        are missing"? Or he will get comments on the prioritization. well, if you
        do this and this, [say] chiller resets, we can do that in house. [to M0F0]
        "your cost is going to be even less that what you estimated, and the payback
        therefore is going to be quicker, and it looks like that could move up on
        your list". [energy manager as client] right, [he is], and vice-versa, he
        may come to me and say "we don''t have funding for this. we could not get
        it. but the payback is two to one. Can you execute this out of your dollars"?
        usually they are small dollar things. "hey, we have got a boiler that will
        burn waste oil from a kitchen can be put it in [install it]"? we don''t have
        the money to install it but we know that it is going to have an energy saving,
        it is going to save energy dollars, it is going to help us meet our sustainability
        goals, it is the right thing to do. and I will have no payback what so ever
        in terms of maintenance and repair dollars. it is truly money out the window.
        but I will do it, if it is the right thing to do, but because I know it is
        the right thing for the TOP_MANAGEMENT. [it saves utility dollars] but I''m
        doing it at my expense [maintenance budget]. [metering programs] very much
        so we participate in [metering programs]; we knew that metering was the way
        to go. we actually executed as the O&M guys. we had a couple guys working
        on figuring out which meters were the best and we probably executed, installed,
        a half million dollars worth of meters. it started initially as test, like
        an R&D effort if you will. "these meters appear the best for PLACE1". we will
        put a few of them in and see how it goes. it went great, so we, of course,
        coordinated that with [ORG5, installation electric provider]. The data is
        transmitted through ORG5''s transmission lines to ORG5. We just ended up being
        the contractual vehicle. and we did that when M0F0 had my job. M0F0 again,
        took it out of hide because he knew it was the right thing to do. it takes
        a lot of guts [because you are using dollars that could be used for higher
        profile projects]. a half million dollars would paint a lot of offices, it
        would...a good way to look at it is that your [division''s] offices would
        have been a lot nicer if we had not spent that half million bucks [on metering].
        the end user would redirect that money to painting and repairs. '

    t16:
      block: ' absolutely we look at EE technologies in terms of how it improves maintenance.
        let us say you are replacing a DX system (HVAC) and you look at the mini-split
        and it is just way more efficient. it may cost $5000 extra, but if you just
        do the analysis, even on the back of an envelope, this is a [no-brainer],
        we are going to have to install it. it is not, I don''t think that is mandated.
        it mandated to try to reduce [energy] usage by square footage, and that helps
        you, right. energy use by square footage is mandated to be reduced, but it
        is good, helps. but it is almost not measurable. you don''t have an auditor
        or anybody coming behind and say "you made the right decision or the wrong
        decision". '
      topic: new EE technology improving maintenance
    t17:
      block: ' Yes, M0F0 does the math [on maintenance savings]. when he puts together
        a proposal to do the whole project, he will do the math, look at the payback.
        And those payback [periods] is so low that they become a no-brainer. so he
        may fund a project to do it, but when we do a smaller renovation outside of
        that we will install the same stuff because we have seen the numbers. we know
        that it is a no-brainer. from a practical standpoint, though, that [maintenance
        impact] is not thought out every time and that is not policed. so no mechanism
        to measure the performance. it is very manpower driven, ideally, you|we would
        have somebody on staff to look at this for everything [all energy performance].
        I think that it would pay for itself. it would pay that person''s salary,
        but you|we might not have the authorization to have the person [on staff].
        or if you are [authorized to have]. we are authorized to have M0F0 and one
        other person to help. that person does not have the time to look at every
        decision we make. you|we could probably justify hiring another person, or,
        but then you would have to get the owner''s approval, and the owner [, who
        may say no]. In regard to the LED upgrades on PLACE1, pushing the work to
        ORG5 [has tradeoffs, cost savings but at [the skill''s cost of] facility management
        "learning expense"]. In that case, the OVERALL_MY_TOP_ORG is getting the free
        benefit of not having to use my maintenance dollars. but again it was the
        smart thing to do. With the meters, they are onboard with computers now. with
        one push of a button you know exactly, as the ORG5 guy would normally be responsible
        for sending usage data back to the bill payer. and now the utility provider
        can do that with a push of a button. it reduces his workload. these smart
        meters are really nice, they work really well. [peer activity comparison]
        I hear we are doing pretty good [in comparison to other installations], primarily
        because of FOOTPRINT_REORGANIZATION. it (FOOTPRINT_REORGANIZATION) increased
        the square footage, I think about by 60% or so, a huge number. and, it is
        all brand new energy efficient stuff. how are we doing compared to other [installations]
        with the day-to-day stuff? probably about the same [as them]. and if I had
        to say, I would say a little better than most. primarily because we have M0F0
        who is very proactive. he is very good at getting money for these types of
        things. so it comes down to the personality, the work ethic of the person
        in that division. yes,[he is the champion of energy at PLACE1]. and he is
        good at it. he knows what he is doing. initially, you|we don''t get any [M&R]
        money after new construction. the cost is kind of figured all under warranty.
        as it comes on-line, you|we get money for it. it is interesting; it is the
        same [budgeting] formula whether it is an old building or a new building.
        some better, some worse. you know, I think the newer stuff [facilities] actually
        works, gut feeling, to your|our detriment. it is harder to maintain. if you
        think about ORG39 for example. a ton of money, state of the art facilities,
        and a super network for monitoring energy usage, controlling it, state of
        the art everything. the maintenance on that [facilities] system is huge. that
        campus would be dwarfed by ours, but they have 10x controls techs full time,
        we have 3x [controls techs]. so if you are going to do it right, it cost a
        lot in terms of maintenance. I''m not sure, people have adjusted the levell
        [of funding] to take care of that. if you|we really want the energy savings,
        if you want to make those savings sustainable, you|we have to budget for the
        maintenance. '

      block: ' very, very computer driven. your|our maintenance people in the future,
        and luckily all our kids are pretty computer savvy. if anybody is going to
        turn a wrench in the future, [they] better know how to do some programming.
        even on a [toilet], they all are going to become computer programmers. Exactly,
        [devices will talk to the building system to tell about status] down to the,
        even the locks, the door closures, maybe even the hinges. if you want to get
        a little outrageous, the hinge on this door is getting a little squeaky and
        that is going to be a [future] problem. I mean, computers are getting so cheap,
        you could almost envision someday everything being tied in. and the computer
        kind of telling you, or maybe even doing it itself, this needs maintenance
        right now. I think in my mind as a facility manager, technology is the only
        way to do things better. better tools. I''m liking it to a locksmith who is
        cutting keys. if you have the old fashion piece of equipment it takes 5 minutes
        to cut a key. if you have a computer aided one, it is a minute, now. it costs
        some money, but it is only going to get better if you put the right tools
        in their|our hands. a lot of that is going to be training in terms of running
        the computer, programming them, seeing what is wrong with what is not working
        right. [there is an investment in equipment and skills], you are right. Yes,
        [I have to stay on top of the EE technology]. not only me, but the [PLACE1]
        workforce. So we, I get routinely, as the money, as the person sort of in
        charge of the purse strings, I will routinely get asked for money to be authorized
        to do training. almost every time I say "yes". I''m very supportive of that.
        [effective use of energy] at Benning, occupancy sensors are huge. if you hang
        around here a night sometime, you will see what I mean, it is very well lit.
        I think at PLACE1 you|we could, I have always told M0F0, "what you really
        need to do is fund. it is so simple that it just doesn''t sell. you need two
        people, full time, to work out here from 8pm until 4am or 5am. Guys, you got
        one job, one job only. Go find problems. Write up services order to fix them.
        Or go turn off the light switch off yourself". The payback would be instant.
        every night you would pay that guy $130 and every night you would save $500
        at least. that is pretty compelling. and I don''t know why we don''t. now,
        what I do to make that happen is, we do have a night shift emergency response
        person. and I have put on his list of duties, to go identify areas that need
        occupancy sensors, and feed that back to people executing the projects for
        M0F0. Usually your nightshift person is not busy 24x7. the whole time he is
        there or you|we can make him busy with something, so what is going to be?

      block: ' I thought I had given ORG4 a work order to bring it back up to speed
        and do the maintenance. Specific to that rainwater collection system; the
        con is that system requires maintenance; it requires someone to do something.
        The pro is a no-brainer, you are re-using water, and you are cutting down
        on your water usage. If we paid for our water, which we don''t right now,
        we just pay a flat rate for water service [on PLACE1]. If we paid for our
        water, I know that that maintenance cost would cut down on the [water] bill.
        So, to me it is kind of a no-brainer to do it. That is why I tasked ORG4 with
        getting that system back up to speed and operating. And if that is not happening,
        I will make sure it is. [mandating that the local water provider delivery
        X amount of reclaimed water would perhaps make more conceptual sense then
        owning a rainwater collection system] that is a great example there, because
        it is a great example of, really, purely from a monetary standpoint, we should
        not touch that rainwater collection system. It should just sit there because
        we are getting our water at a flat rate [for the entire installation]. But,
        it is a. but I think you have to have a longer term view. That flat rate is
        not going to last forever. My reason for wanting that to work; two reasons,
        one, long term I think we are going to need it. So I figure that if you don''t
        keep it in operating condition, it [rainwater collection system] will get
        so bad that you|we are not going to be able to use it when you|we need to.

        bill. In this case [PLACE1] property management is delegated by the ASST_CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORG
        to the real property people to handle turning over the keys and all that stuff.
        But G0S0 really acts as the owner; he writes the checks and pays the bills.
        And oversees the maintenance and repair. If you think about the ORG3 guys
        who handle your leases, they don''t really. unless you are talking about some
        land where there is just trees and stuff. they don''t really handle maintenance.
        They don''t even handle maintenance of that ground, G0S0 does. [new construction
        or acquisition] it almost seems like the ORG3 assists the real property people
        with property management during the acquisition [in contrast to being directly
        responsible] Getting the real property angle is a good idea. Getting my angle
        as the facility manager is good. I''m clearly the facility manager. this may
        be shared a bit with [R0C0 (design)], he helps me with the major upgrades.
        He is not working for me, he is working for C0T1 [chief, ORG2]. [R0C0] is
        the chief of the engineering division. So you have under C0T1, you have [R0C0]
        to handle your major capital upgrades, your major repair projects. R0C0 oversees
        the design and execution of the work. C0T1 has me for the day-to-day facility
        management, preventive maintenance, operations of utility plants, unplugging
        toilets, fixing air conditioning. most people think of that as the aspects
        of facility management. And then C0T1 has his real property people who hand
        over keys, and make sure the lease is right, and they understand what their
        bill is. Which I think is a property management function. My background as
        a landlord kind of helps put some perspective on it. When you see it in real

        I will tend to mandate to my maintenance contractor; do this one smarter,
        we know from past experience that the payback is 3-years [example], so we
        just got to do. Again, if we had more manpower we probably would not only
        look at the smartest way to do it, but what is the smartest product. Tweak
        it a little more. M0F0 does the lifecycle analysis on all his big projects.
        He is looking not only the immediate cost, and the immediate payback in energy
        savings, but he is also looking at the maintenance costs. All that factors
        in. For the cooling tower wind turbine, I think that is why we are only getting
        a 20 year payback right now because it is in its infancy. The cost per unit
        has not come down; maintenance cost is probably still high. It is an emerging

        is it going to be to upgrade? What is the nature of the building? Is it one

        where it is just bad [dated processes]. We did not do that in 1963 so why
        should we do it now? There is a lot of that [behavior or attitude]. Especially

        Therefore, if I [the manager] don''t know it or cannot understand it, I don''t
        want to have anything to do with it. Part of it is that the [lack of knowing

        in, or maybe even capable of, understanding some of that stuff [new technology].
        Or maybe more importantly, they might be busy doing their day job, fixing
        something that is not working. To me the key is the funding. If you really
        want sustainability and EE, you have got to commit, and you have just got
        to make a commitment to say, "man, we are; instead of reducing the sustainment
        dollars, we are going to increase them". And then train our O&M manager, our
        energy managers, and our directors, with what they need, where they need to
        beef up to do it. We don''t want to you guys to go out and hire more grass

        give to R0C1 for renovations and things. And what is the best answer. You
        could give it to me, and we would split it. So perhaps it is better to give
        more of it to R0C1 because in the process of doing his renovations, the return
        on investment is greater than what I would do. Because when you renovate a

        like it. A great, great, example is in our, in the area where we work on OPERATION_TYPE2.
        It is pretty important to see what you are doing [for that activity]. [reducing

        to. To be more proactive is just more effort. It is [a negative to the benefit

        better. I don''t really see the results of changes [to building energy use].
        There is revenue recapture, in a way, there is a little bit, because if we
        under. if our [utility] bill comes in under what it was projected to be, we
        will end up with year-end money to spend on equipment. You|we could buy new

        every year. The year-end fallout. Some of the left over year-end monies come
        my way, but not all. So, there is a payback [that we see directly]. Better
        EE equipment provides a benefit [in terms of humidity control] but I also
        see it as a drawback, some of the new equipment, if working properly, will
        prevent mold, reduce humidity levels, improve energy consumption. when not
        maintained, the failure is more catastrophic. A good example is the PLACE3;
        look at the condensation problems when those things get out of whack. Another
        good example is the BLDGCODE9_TYPE right across the street (BLDGCODE1, BLDGCODE2).

      block: ' programs for saving energy? My work background is in project management.
        I was in [a sister agency] for 5-years as an [project manager] doing engineering
        reviews and moved over into the environmental field. then I worked in the
        private sector as a project manager. Then I came here to PLACE1.  right, I
        agree. [green programs] I don''t think LEED is the biggest program for making
        things EE. You can have a LEED building, that is great. but you know, the
        ORG3 is going to build building with or without LEED to be energy efficient.
        ORG2 is participating in programs. I think we have two things going on. You
        have new construction. You have all of the rules that with or without LEED
        are driving you to energy conserving techniques. we can see on the air conditioning
        systems, we see in the insulation of the roofs, and the sustainable things
        they are doing. to me that. I don''t know that LEED would help you out, but
        maybe LEED would give you 10-20% [efficiency] more if you got LEED certified.
        if you look at the bulk of what has changed over the last 10-15 years of construction,
        I think it is more driven by our designers and the goals and the requirements
        they put on [the projects] for EE. But when you are looking retroactively,
        try to save [energy] on the older facilities, it is hugely driven by what
        M0F0 [the energy manager] is doing with the money that is specifically ear
        marked and dedicated to saving energy. A great example is lighting projects.
        In the last year, M0F0 has sent a million dollars my way to put in occupancy
        sensors and lights. and it is really working pretty good, yeah. We have got
        people who are running around [doing this work full time].  yes, very much
        so. and it upper management driven. M0F0 is a key part of that because he
        is the energy manager. he looks at [project] ideas and he has a person who
        works for him and goes and looks for [project] ideas. and he puts them together
        as projects and sends it up to upper management and gets it funded based on
        return (ROI). so that is where the action is [for EE] outside of new construction.
        [facility management''s participation in M0F0 projects.] Yes, very much so,
        we participate in M0F0''s projects. Not only as the maintenance manager, but
        also we execute the work with a lot of our regular techs (shop personnel).
        well, if you got to replace lights, our electricians can do that. so if he
        sends money my way we will execute it. M0F0 can use nearly all contractual
        avenues. When he uses guys who do the maintenance to do his [EE] upgrades
        then they are in tune with how it is installed, how it works, how to maintain
        it. it brings [some training]. it also makes them more in tune with what we
        are trying to do [regarding EE], there is more ownership there. To tie back
        to facility management; the facility manager is really tied in when it comes
        to the operation [of the facility] for [more than just] the maintenance [of
        the facility]. The operations side would be [an example] like the energy management
        system (EMS) control center, where you have all these buildings that can be
        programmed to have setbacks in the summer and winter to save energy. We operate
        that. So M0F0 may be in charge of getting those system upgraded so they work
        better, but ultimately it comes back to me to operate it. If it is not operated
        correctly it does not [do any good for saving energy]. '
      topic: green programs

      block: ' Strategy? Less strategy, more regulation driven. let us say that you
        replace what would looks like a household air conditioning unit. you are kind
        of required now to buy a certain efficiency [that exceeds a minimum efficiency].
        It is a mandate, really. So there is the mandate and then there is for me,
        the desire, just to do the right thing. I believe there is [something for
        ORG2]. M0F0 would be the point of contact for that, but there is specific
        goals of reduction per square foot. I have seen them and I know that M0F0
        tracks them. My play in that [square foot reductions], lack of a better way
        to say it, is to do what I am told [conform to requirements]. You know, because
        there is not a lot of give way [room to change]. M0F0 and I are partners on
        this. He is the brains behind [the projects]. I am the dumb guy who replaces
        chillers, unplugs toilets. The way we work, we sort of execute, we operate
        the systems. M0F0 is the [embodiment of the] strategy and tracks the performance
        against the goals; the person who decides from a maintenance standpoint that
        your|my biggest bang for the buck is this, this, and this. Where I come into
        it, a good example, a real example from the other day was the replacement
        of a chiller. and we had a decision to make on that chiller. to buy this one
        or to buy that one. and the more efficient one was more expensive. there were
        other factors, lead time, the less efficient one might have been. trying to
        remember the actual decision reasons. how quick can it get here, how much
        does it cost, what is the efficiency. So, that comes down to me to make that
        decision. I will spend more money even if I don''t have all of the numbers.
        I can say I think this is more energy efficient and I can see a payback on
        doing this. it might cost 20k extra bucks but I know the payback is at least
        a thousand a year. [so it is a good deal so] we will buy the more expensive
        one. translating M0F0''s strategy to facility management, a lot times the
        energy manager works for the O&M manager, on the O&M manager''s staff, probably
        working with another mechanical engineer working on my staff. looking at our
        maintenance to make sure the we are doing the maintenance. what we spend on
        maintenance has the payback in terms of energy savings. and as you do repairs
        making sure that you bought the right thing. so M0F0 is the tracker, the brains
        behind the operation, for what is the smart thing to do. my standpoint is
        we have a fixed amount of money to spend on these things. so, you only have
        so much money. I''m sure you can imagine that. I might have a 2-year payback
        but if it is 5-million dollars [in first cost] then it is a no-go. I just
        don''t have that [amount of] money. my role is kind of a decision maker on
        execution, do I have the money to do some of this. [if I get above a threshold
        of investment] then it is not feasible. on the other hand, I may make a decision
        to spend money on, like, wind turbines [for cooling towers]. they put them
        on the top of a cooling tower exhaust and they recover the energy that gets
        blown out into the atmosphere. the payback is not so great right now because
        it is an R&D effort. but if it is not a lot of money and I can afford to support
        or do it then we will try one or two because it is the right thing to do.
        we just want to advance the science. so I kind of am the decision maker on
        the day-to-day [investment] how are we going to spend our maintenance money
        in the wisest fashion. '

        what [building stock] we already have. and, then if we cannot, then they go
        ahead and they will put in a FORM2X to start the process [for a project].
        +\D0MP1\+ a FORM2X to start the process, they need to get a FORM2X to me.
        for everything [they need]. what they want to do. what they just want to prepare.
        that really gets into the requirements and recommendations, checking what
        we have as far as the PROGRAM8. +\J0MP1\+ you get certain allowance for certain
        categories of facilities. +\G3MP1\+ you are authorized certain allowances.
        +\D0MP1\+ in some cases, [such as] that is the one we have identified this
        year, like the PROCESS_CONTROL_SYS1 [in this] instance. [how it] works in
        the OVERALL_MY_TOP_ORG (he likely means to say the authority responsible for
        OPERATION_TYPE1 management), they turn around and try to do an inspection
        about how it works in the OVERALL_MY_TOP_ORG [OPERATION_TYPE1 control process].
        so, we need [to make changes to the PROCESS_CONTROL_SYS1] and from there we
        can generate a FORM2X and a FORM1X. the FORM1X is what programs the project
        [for funding]. that identifies what we [in master planning] need [to manage
        the project programming]. but some of this stuff, like the project we got
        the two BLDGCODE19_TYPE buildings with. that was actually a three phase project
        to build us a ORG_SIZE_MED OPERATION_ACTIV1 [site] on PLACE13. [the ORG22
        (realty board)] said you are going to build a, they told us, it was top down
        [driven decision]. they were planning to add another ORG_SIZE_MED for OPERATION_ACTIV1,
        and they were going to do it in three phases. we ended up with a BLDGCODE14_TYPE
        facility in phase one that we did not need. this was from when [the previous
        CHIEF_EXECUTIVE for the ORG59] was here. It turned out that they did not need
        [the BLDGCODE14_TYPE] because they got [the facility''s services] through
        some other means. they asked to move the BLDGCODE19_TYPE [facility] from phase
        two to phase one. and, they did that [programming move]. no, they [actually]
        asked to move [the BLDGCODE19_TYPE] from phase three to phase two. the BLDGCODE14_TYPE
        fell out of phase two, or rather the expansion of the BLDGCODE14_TYPE (D0MP1
        corrected himself about the BLDGCODE14_TYPE being in phase one). but, they
        never removed [the BLDGCODE19_TYPE] from phase three. so, we ended up with
        two of them. the problem is that on that BLDGCODE19_TYPE category, [our facility
        management system was showing that] we were still short [on space square footage].
        we were still allowed [to do the construction] so nobody bother to take it
        out [of the funding process] because we were still short. they did not tell
        ORG16 anything so we ended up getting two [BLDGCODE19_TYPEs]. so, that is
        what sometimes happens. and, we ended up getting two [BLDGCODE19_TYPEs] that
        we were justified in getting. when it was all said and done, we [actually]
        did not need [the second BLDGCODE19_TYPE]. [but we will get good use for it
        as a ORG21 facility when the category code is changed]. +\G3MP1\+ when the
        box is checked for the categories on the FORM1X as [the project] is programmed.
        the next step is that it would go to the planning board for site approval.
        the planning board is at the FFLEET_MANAGEMENT level [for FORM1Xs (those forms
        are used for new construction)]. +\D0MP1\+ I guess that it applies to, we
        would only worry about PROGRAM5 (new construction), FORM1Xs. but, I would
        guess it would apply also to. would it apply to PROGRAM7 [funding] (maintenance
        and repair funds)? +\G3MP1\+ no, [not] for building additions, no. +\D0MP1\+
        what about building something small? you know, 2000, 3000 square foot? +\G3MP1\+
        small buildings, well, yeah, I don''t know. +\J0MP1\+ I actually asked that
        question [during my training course], technically yes, but don''t bother.
        if it is small, [then] don''t really worry about it [for category rules and
        changes that would normally be approved by the FFLEET_MANAGEMENT planning
        board]. it basically just shows up from our office side of things. +\D0MP1\+
        if it is 750-grand then it is not a small project. So, it would be more like
        4000, 5000 square feet. +\J0MP1\+ so, there is our PROGRAM5 projects, of course,
        there are more than there is money for, so we will have a one-to-"N" list.
        we present [the list] to [our] RPB (Realty Planning Board) and we get the
        CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORG and the CHIEF_EXECUTIVE_BEC, and everybody else. and,
        they say that is right, or they change these around. and, then we have to
        submit one version to FFLEET_MANAGEMENT and one version to ORG20, one version
        to ORG14, because they are all proponents for different areas. and, then they
        go up and they fight for the funding. and, it then goes through this long
        process and they come back and say this project is being funded. and, it moves
        forward from there. '

        and operate those solar panels for a 35-year easement. They have easement
        restrictions to what they have to do. They have to abide by certain things
        while they are on the property. It is an easement instead of a lease. They
        will have meets and bounds just like a lease would. Besides owners, which
        is "fee [simple] (using the formal definition)", the next thing is a lease,
        which gives you more real say interest. Next comes an easement. And then you
        get your licenses and permits. there are other restrictions on the [solar]
        site. There is some kind of agreement as to what happens to that power. Where
        it goes through and how much right we have to it, first right to it. If they

        will be between ORG12 and ORG19. [in regard to higher approval], let me tell
        you why it goes up to those levels. The process came about three years ago,
        maybe, don''t quote me an exact time. if there will be any kind of improvements
        on our land that is over 750-thousand dollars, then [the project approval]
        must go to that level. [It does not matter] who is paying for it, it has to
        go. when they built that hospital, it had to go up [to that level]. Because
        they are saying, "do we want, do we approve of this being done on our land".
        So, now [any project] over 750k gets kicked up to that level. Usually it will
        just go from here to FFLEET_MANAGEMENT in PLACE16, and sometimes to the DIRECTORATE2.
        Ok, which is over FFLEET_MANAGEMENT, ORG20, ORG14. I''m [mostly] at work on
        PROGRAM4 stuff now, so I don''t use all kind of acronyms [anymore]. Anyway,
        different levels for different [funding] approvals. ORG16 [level] is DIRECTORATE2.
        From there it goes up to a board. [that] board is by DIRECTORATE3. [Acronym
        components for DIRECTORATE3] and, the P stands for, don''t quote me, not projects,
        but privatization. They added a "P" in there lately. So, that is why it goes.
        they have a lot of checks and balances for what you do. so, that is the easement.
        land leases are a lot like easements. they are for shorter terms. Depending
        on the activity. now the banks, when we did new construction, lots of times
        they may give you, the used to give you twenty, twenty-five year [leases]
        when they came out here and built. that way they can write-off their improvements
        over a period of time. When it came to cell-towers, it was much less. it was
        only ten years, with some year options. but, normally it is only five year
        leases. does that help [clarify ownership]? '

        give you an example, if we have a pump that has a variable frequency drive
        on it and if there is any issues with the flow of water, then the maintenance
        mechanic would just as soon turn off the variable frequency drive and cut
        the pump on full speed 24x7 to keep the customer happy. But he, [the mechanic,]
        never sees the utility bill for his actions. In other views, like design,
        that view energy as like [not that important] because we have restrictions

        engineers, the electrical engineers, understand the need for energy efficiency,
        such as putting in smaller horsepower motors. Not only [does this save] in
        the sizing of the motor itself, but it also [this] saves in the sizing of

        of money (overall). For our agency here, we are embracing the technologies
        as they come along. Energy efficiency is certainly important to the TOP_MANGEMENT.
        We have goals that go all the way out to, say the year yr-2025, that requires
        [that we save a set] percentage of energy, and some of that energy must come
        from renewable sources. also, the net zero requirements for some buildings
        by the year yr-2030. as we go further out, [TOP_MANAGEMENT] policy requires
        us to be more green and more efficient in what we do. Those are policy driven
        [not investment driven] initiatives. We [do not] embrace [those policies]
        at the level we should or could. and, even when [we go in and] look at the
        simple things like metering, [which is] the basis for any energy manager making
        an evaluation, to be able to do projects, submit projects, you really want
        metered data. Metered data tells you where your problems are. And, then after

        is one of those things that has been on our plate for ten years and still
        not everything is one hundred percent metered. So, [instead] we just build
        a new building and [then] we [do not] put meters on it and then we later have

        projects were certified and some were not. But the requirement is that [all]
        these projects would be certified. So you [also] have to pay for the person
        to come in and certify it post-construction. that is where the other programs
        [similar to] Leed, [can exceed the effectiveness of] the LEED program. the
        LEED [program] is a US buildings Council program. but there is another organization,
        another world organization, and I think Australia is really big into that,
        but they have some method where you [do not] get the certification until you
        prove that you''ve actually saved the energy. So if you said you [did not]
        go in and get 40% reduction according to ASHRAE standard 90-1. they actually
        have to demonstrate that they have done that. And they have the measurement
        and verification, [such as having the] test and balance guy say that [the
        project] met [TAB standards]. So that program is competing with the US building
        Council LEED program. I have been told by people who seem to know that that
        is where we are headed. So we may accept a non-US certification program. A
        world organization program. '

        then [you see that] we stack up pretty good against the other installations
        in the REGION1. We stack up pretty good with most everybody in the FFLEET_MANAGEMENT,
        meaning that we are in the top 25%. That''s on a kbtu per thousand square

        say, yeah, but you [we] [do not] have those cold harsh winters like PLACE9.
        True, but they [do not] have the heavy air-conditioning load either. So, it
        is a snapshot in time, it seems to me like you see installations that will
        drop their energy use for short period time then it will level out for a while.
        it will either go up or go back down. So, your performance is snapshot in
        time. I think that [change in usage] is a function of changes in personnel
        and where [their] priorities are. here is a prime example [at] PLACE1. we
        have a requirement to reduce water use to the level of yr-2005. but, in 2005
        we had just recently privatized the water system. So, we have to reduce our
        water use by 2% per year for the next ten years [from yr-2005]. So, [in yr-2005]
        we turned it over to ORG6 and first thing they did is checked for all the
        locations [the system] had leaks. They fixed those leaks, and some of those
        leaks were substantial. We, PLACE1, had not spent any time fixing those leaks,
        mostly because we were preparing to privatize. So, [because we had a high
        level of yr-2005 water use] we now have met the 2% goals without really doing
        anything. So, we''re not spending any effort toward water. I [do not] have
        a single water project. When we get past yr-2015, then in yr-2016 we will
        have another goal and then water will have a greater priority. at that point
        I will start putting in water projects. You have priorities that change as
        the years go by depending upon your snapshot. We are doing so well in water
        that there is an open question as to why we should do anything about. For
        me, I should be spending some effort on it, but when I see that there''s more
        bang for my buck to spend effort on energy [efficiency] and that is where
        I focus [my time and energy] . '

        There have been enough failures in sustainability that they may make a personal

        for DIRECTORATE1. Under her is a CHIEF_EXECUTIVES_CAT3, the CHIEF_FFLEET_PROP_ORG
        in charge of FFLEET_MANAGEMENT. [He has the ownership piece and also he has

        belongs to the ORG3. The ORG3 is the responsible party for facilities and
        that is up at the ORG13 level. Because only the ORG3 can own real estate [in
        the OVERALL_MY_TOP_ORG]. That is law [how the legislature structured it] ORG12
        is the owner of the property at PLACE1. This building belongs to ORG12. ORG12
        has sub-hand receipted it to our CHIEF_REAL_ESTATE. our CHIEF_REAL_ESTATE
        [signs] it out to other people. the other day, E1C2, who works in our [property
        management office] was doing something that [S1W0] use to do. he would head
        out to a facility. he had the user who was maintaining the facility, the user
        who was moving into the facility, and this guy pulled out the, FORM4X, that
        lists everything in the building and what it is. And then he took that form
        and handed it to the other guy to sign, he signed it, they did a walk through
        inventory, this was a change of a Building-inventory-control. the new guy,
        MAIN_MANAGER of the building, then has taken over the building from the other
        guy. they probably listed all of the deficiencies they had in the building
        on the form. kind of like a landlord would do at the time he has a new tenant
        coming in. the fortunate thing there was able to get the outgoing guy and

        is 167-watts. and you cut it (switch) off and they [switch another] on and
        you see that that one is 440-watts. so [the question is] which one of them
        would buy? and they say, "well, the one that is 167-watts looks like it is

        so what is the difference in the cost between the fixture? that is where [the

        costs 400-dollars. well, how much energy is this fixture going to use over
        the course of a year? well, this one is going to use 197-dollars and the other
        one is going to use 490-dollars. so, [in terms of cost] it is a no-brainer.
        if you buy the other fixture, then in a year [it is a lot more money]. anyway,
        taking them to the showroom where you can actually see it and then do your
        comparisons, that really solidified the effort for them to specify the better

        that [submission]". first of all, you have to have 1-year''s worth of metered
        data for that building; water, electricity, and gas. If you [do not] have

        in yr-2014 all the meters on [that building] and collect data for the next

        a LEED whatever standard, whatever he wants too. and, then we can compete.
        and we can win. but first of all, you have to have the metered data. but,
        when we operate from a year-to-year basis then I have the year yr-2014 projects
        that R0C0 is doing. we can go in and excel at one or more of those projects,
        and really reduce the energy, make it way more sustainable and we will not
        win anything because I [do not] have the yr-2013 utility data. I have 980-meters
        on [this installation]. [I am] metering 75% of the electricity. [I am] doing
        a lot for electric, but not with water and gas. So, if I [do not] have the
        water meter and I [do not] have the gas meter, than it is all for not. to
        be able to put it in a green program. every year C0T1 asks me what projects,
        which one are R0C0 working on that you can do. you cannot look at it from
        a 1-year standpoint, you have to look at it [from] 2-years out. because I
        have to go in and make sure that I have a water meter installed and a gas
        meter installed; get a year''s worth of data, and then to show after we have
        done the project, and then. so, typically it is a 3-year cycle. so, we would
        have a project, say, in yr-2013 that we would go in and meter the building
        because we would think that we are going to renovate [the building] in yr-2014.
        we would [then] renovate it in yr-2014, and then I would have all of the utility
        data for a year or a portion of a year after that to show that [the energy
        use in the building] has gone down. you have to demonstrate that. so, it is
        not a snapshot in time. it has to be something that is planned over more than
        18-months, typically 2pt5-years. [because of the give and take in the project
        development process] you have to make your best guesses and then if you have
        one [that goes forward and can compete] that is fine, if you [do not] then
        that is fine too. for me, buildings that would have been awesome building
        for [a green building award] would have been BLDGCODE5, the old museum that
        we are renovating for ORG15. any one of the buildings up there would have
        been a good [choice]. but I [do not] have the metered data for the time [period]
        before. I could use a BLDGCODE20_TYPE, but we are not receiving that much
        of a savings for those buildings. if we were at 13-watts per square foot and
        [a project] took it down to 11-watts per square foot, we only save 2-watts
        per square foot. now, for the buildings that are going to be on the ground
        source loop, that is something that can go [in for an award] if I can collect
        some data, but I [do not] have gas readings. I still [do not] have gas readings.
        so, I can''t even compete those building [even though they are very energy
        efficient]. and then on the installation of the water meters. you know we
        are installing water meters in the BLDGCODE20_TYPE projects. I had gone out
        because I did not have water meters on these and I did a 680,000-dollar project
        with ORG6 to put all these water meters in and then when they started the
        BLDGCODE20_TYPE projects they said, no, no, no, we are putting a new line
        to the building and we are going to have not eight feeds into the building,
        instead we will have one feed into the building. so, now my efforts for the
        water meters is all out the window. I say, gosh, I [do not] want to cancel
        that contract, but [I am] going to have to mod the hell out of it. but R0C0
        says for even those TBLDGCODE20_TYPEs that are going to be in years yr-16,
        yr-17, and yr-18, he wants me not to put in water meter in those buildings.
        It is an engineering call, so as the energy manager, [I am] not going to fuss
        with the engineering call, but I would do something different. I would go
        ahead and. the green building thing, if you go in and you take a building
        and you show that that is operating in the top 25% of [those buildings] then
        you do not have to do the energy audit on that building, and that is good
        for 4-years. and then you go back in 4-years later and say that it is the
        top 25%. but you have to have metered data and you have to register [the building],
        in the energystar portfolio. right, in the energystar portfolio, you put it
        in there and if it meets the standard of the top 25% [of buildings] then you
        can remove it from your list of buildings that you have to audit. but then
        for me, it is kind of like you are removing it from one list that you are
        auditing but maybe you should be auditing it anyway. but for me there is no
        way that I can do an audit of 25% of the buildings here in a year. ok, what
        is 25%? well, it would be. let''s just assume that it is 200-buildings [for
        25%]. that would be one every work day. well, how long does it take to audit
        a building? some of them are more than a day. lots of them are less than a
        day. but it would be more than 200-days worth of work. so if I spent full-time
        on it, I would be just barely meeting the standard. and then I have all the,
        everything else to do. you cannot get there from here. '

        LEED; gold, platinum, and so on. However, [I am] not the right person to talk
        to about sustainability programs. You will need to talk to P0L0. Any activity
        regarding energyStar? We have a program that when Contracting purchases items
        they must only purchase energyStar items. If the [products] do not have the
        energyStar rating on the [them], [they should not] purchase the item. We require
        equipment to be certified energyStar. There is a desire for us to participate
        in the green building program for the energyStar program buildings. Because
        we are required by Executive Order to do an audit of [our] facilities and
        [that] we should have all of our eligible facilities audited once every four
        years. That is a very daunting task. So, we have employed the help of others.
        We had the comprehensive evaluation water team come down and I had them train
        a couple of people who work for ORG4 on how to do the comprehensive audits.
        These audits are then loaded into FEDS, the facility energy decision system,
        a tool that was created between Pacific Northwest labs and the US Army Corps
        of Engineers. And, it helps you determine what projects should be executed
        for energy projects. There is evolving stuff in the background. '

    t6:
      block: ' When we go in and we look to decreasing the amount of energy consumed,
        there are a couple of ways we can do it. One way is under all new construction
        so that we can [start with better facilities]. The second way is that we submit
        projects as energy [retrofit] projects. There is a variety of different funding
        streams. One funding stream is called PROGRAM1, being an acronym from FFLEET_MANAGEMENT.
        We submit projects with savings to investment ratios, i/e, paybacks to FFLEET_MANAGEMENT.
        FFLEET_MANAGEMENT racks and stacks those projects. the ones that are at the
        top of the list based on paybacks get funded. This year for the OVERALL_MY_TOP_ORG,
        they were going to fund the first 151-million dollars. For us we had two projects
        in the first disbursement of [roughly 40% of the total]. So, we got those
        two projects [funded]. and, also [we have] another fourteen projects that
        are above the 151-million dollar line. So, we are hoping to get more money,
        the sooner the better. It is a fenced pot of money. The two projects that
        were funded, were [integrated into PROJECT1]. so I''ve taken that $800,000
        and [sent it] to S0L1 at ORG7. So, S0L1 will coordinate their activities for
        bidding to contractors, award to a contractor, [and then] that contractor
        will [then] come to PLACE1. And, S0L1 will have the local ORG3 area office
        do the the quality assurance (QA). So that''s the PROGRAM1 projects. Another
        funding stream is the PROGRAM2 energy conservation investment program. It
        is the oldest program for money. PROGRAM2 usually follows things that are
        bigger projects. You probably begin most of these projects at over 1-million
        dollars. And, they probably go up to around 6-million to 8-million dollars.
        That is the uppermost limit. The OVERALL_MY_TOP_ORG gets about 50-million
        dollars per year. We submitted one [PROGRAM2 project] for PLACE1 for chillers.
        The payback has to be good. you have to have an SIR better than 1pt5 to be
        considered. There is a lot more scrutiny for the PROGRAM2. There [are] a lot
        of people who look at [those proposed projects]. Generally all those projects
        are managed by the ORG3, who does the design and construction. The decentralization
        [of the heating] of PLACE8, that was done about fifteen years ago. that was
        done as an PROGRAM2. That was the first one at PLACE1. And, it was about 3pt5-million
        dollar project. What we did there was we took buildings off the central plant
        and put boilers in each building and in this way we cut [down our] distribution
        losses. It had been an incredibly high SIR. It was like three-point something.
        The reason why [was that,] we had steam distribution lines that needed to
        be replaced and the replacement cost was very high, about 5-million dollars.
        and the PROGRAM2 project was only 3pt5-million dollars. It was cheaper [to
        do the PROGRAM2 project]. What we could not do was [use] maintenance and repair
        funds ##COM1## to put new boilers in each of the buildings [and decentralize
        using M&R dollars]. So there also was the color of money issue [that constrained
        project funding]. The PROGRAM2 allows the inclusion of new work whereas maintenance
        and repair funds cannot be used for new work. PROGRAM1 on the other hand is
        meant for maintenance and repair. but PROGRAM2 is only funded totally at 50-million
        per year. But the PROGRAM1 is greater than 100-million per year. So we spend
        most of our efforts toward PROGRAM1. '

        PROGRAM3 is a collaboration between Department of Energy, EPA, and [other

        out to the [agencies,] and to the [Federal] government in general. It started
        out being new ideas, sort of a part of DARPA, designing better [equipment]
        type thing, then it evolved to where they have an energy component [for research].
        [I am] involved in four initiatives in that program. They are more paperwork
        driven. an example of that is, the optimization of electric [generation] assets.
        Sometimes that has ability to affect your electric rates. If you take your
        generation assets and you use them [for not only emergency generation, but
        also other electric generation] then all of a sudden you [can] lower your
        electric [billing] rate. then it is like gosh, why are we not using this electric
        generation asset [more than as emergency standby]. This was done as a survey.
        In some locations the survey showed surprising results, [such as] PLACE4 where
        they were paying a hell of an electric rate [in comparison] to us. So, at
        that location it was beneficial to use the electric generation assets more.
        But for our study it was not economical for us to proceed to use those assets.
        We have a low electric rate and are [also] able to obtain subsidies from the
        local power company. So that was it that the study, and that was mostly academic.
        but we have others that are [more constructable]. We have one this year, where
        we take 4-tons of trash, [put it] into this boiler and generate electricity.
        This is 4-tons of trash per day. If [that is] successful, we will do some
        type of large project to do it at a much larger scale. We will take trash
        and generate renewable energy from the trash. You''re really getting rid of
        two problems, trash and electric purchasing, and do it economically. So we
        have submitted for the project. There''s others that I have that are ongoing,

        was a large wind turbine, about 6-ft by 6-ft. they were looking for a pilot
        program for that. so we worked with them for 6-7 months and we put it on one
        HVAC system. it did not do what they said it was going to do. so we performed
        an analysis at the ORG2 (FM) level. they went back, they re-engineered it,
        they came back with it. and they still had to tweak it over a year, a period
        of time. but right now it is, it is a tremendously advantageous purchase.

        time [that AC operation] is extremely costly. so there may be a different
        angle on that. so using this large dehumidification system that is fairly
        inexpensive, 15,000-20,000 [dollars], that is what the guesstimate is. but
        with that desiccant wheel it removes, in the daytime with the sun going, it
        removes all of the humidity in the building. and you|we are not having to

        not look at the point system regionally. so if you spend a million dollars
        on PV in STATE4, it is the same LEED point as in STATE1. but we have 4_3-hours
        of sunlight versus their 8_1-[hours], or whatever [the value is]. so the point
        system is skewed to help those with more renewable energy in their geographical
        area. we are not in a wind corridor. we really are not in available solar
        even though we are doing PV now. it is not optimal to use solar. the geothermal,
        the deep earth geothermal, is not here. other than ground source heat pumps.

        a winner. LEED is not tied to [an] ROI. so every time what should take place,

        of course, if you run an ROI on it. it is not comparable with LEED because
        LEED incorporates so many environmental aspects to it that you cannot run
        an ROI on that. bike racks, recycling, exactly. green roofing, water conservation.
        so a high performance building would be geared toward energy and pretty much
        strictly energy. some of the [LEED design criteria] makes sense, some of it
        does not make sense. in the corporate arena, obviously if they are the landlord,
        they will incorporate a lot of that. but if it is actually a spec building
        and they turn it right over, then they could care less about the ROI. so I
        think that is one reason that LEED-usgbc has failed [in the commercial sector].
        whereas the TOP_AGENCY, the federal government is going to keep that building.

        all encroachment areas in sustainability [process]. and leading back to, i
        got off track there. FOOTPRINT_REORGANIZATION made them realize that they
        would [likely] have another round of FOOTPRINT_REORGANIZATION ten years later.
        so how did, how did the [local] community relationships. how did sustainability
        with the environment. how did sustainability with energy, effect the FOOTPRINT_REORGANIZATION
        round (i_e_, future TOP_AGENCY facility use choices). and I think that is
        why they had a big push to incorporate sustainability parameters [and processes]

        Windtronics that looks like it is a winner. but when we have company come
        in and say they have a technology that does such and such, we have no way
        to prove, proving that it does [what they say]. let''s say it is thin film
        PV. they call these claims, claims because they are selling it. but you|we
        really don''t know if it does what it says it does. so, hopefully, this time
        next year we will have a small laboratory. we, we already got the building,
        C0T1 already gave us the building. we are going to do a CREDA with ORG33.
        and maybe eventually with an ESCO as well, to test different products. because
        if we literally buy six hundred thin film PVs and find out that they don''t
        work. the company either lied to us or misrepresented [the product], then
        we are stuck with these things. to be able to take, as a prime example, the
        Windtronics technology, that turbine. K0T0 did analysis on that for six months,
        his team did. and every time we ran an analysis we found out, well, it does
        not quite do, perform, the way you|they said it did. the very last time we
        had them in the office, it did exactly what it was suppose to do, but they
        had to re-engineer it. well that gave us a wake up call, a couple years back

        that hung over the parking lots. but the CFLs did not warm up enough to keep
        the snow off, to melt the snow that would land on it. so eventually, within
        a few weeks they all came crashing down to the ground. because the regular
        light bulbs created enough heat to melt the snow. and the interesting thing
        was that it happened simultaneously at a TOP_SISTER_ORG1 [installation]. they
        don''t talk, they just don''t [talk], you cannot imagine how much money was
        wasted because there was no talking between the two. the design engineers

        hopefully do (validate engineering assumptions). what we will look at is certifying
        some of these projects, too (the design). we cannot afford to do it, but we
        have certified [the design], done the analysis, and have done what they say
        it does. so the [other] installation can say, "we do have the funding, we

        them a lot of money. because they manufactured their carpet, through the process
        they were using, the material they were using, throwing away boxes. they did
        not mean [to waste materials] but that was just the way it had always been
        done. and they were making carpet like that. so when the ISO [process] came
        in, giving a fresh eye, looking at everything. they [then] eliminated a lot
        of [unneeded] processes. and saved an enormous amount of money. the owner
        of the company is Ray Anderson. Ray Anderson took on the mantel of ISO-14000
        around the world. as a matter of fact, he was, Bill Clinton made him the first
        sustainability chairman. He was President Clinton''s sustainability chairman.

        Person of the Year. he is actually GA [native]. he has passed on, a couple
        of years ago. he looked at sustainability as being profitable if it was long
        term. so he turned around the thinking of, with most large corporations, GM
        or Apple. those big corporations had a very myopic, short view. they did not
        look at it the same, "I could be around ten, twenty, thirty years from now".
        so he really, really helped change the thinking of that. he gave, oh I would
        guess, one hundred lectures a year around the world. he gave all these lectures
        to corporate [senior managers] and CEOs. saying "you have got to react to
        [the requirements] that [are coming] ten years, fifteen years from now". Ray
        Anderson spoke to the joint chiefs of staff about 7-8 years ago. and he spoke
        to all the Generals about sustainability. and that is one reason they took
        on sustainability as a [strategic business process] in TOP_AGENCY. He was
        a very very profound leader in the [sustainability] area, and it is a corporate
        area, corporate area. he was all about the bottom line. he was not a green

        can give you a copy I have got it on my desk. from last year. it was call
        the net-zero tracking report. the first one ever done on the installation.
        the first one ever done at a garrison installation. and there is a big push
        for net-zero, net-zero in the TOP_AGENCY. net-zero energy, net-zero water,
        net-zero waste. this report tracks those three at PLACE1, but it also track
        a fourth, which is carbon. that is good stuff, and should be done everywhere
        in the country. so I can give you that report tracks it for the last three
        years. So you go from yr-2012, to yr-2011, to yr-2010, on energy usage. and
        we also track, and that is with FOOTPRINT_REORGANIZATION going on, so we have
        showed a reduction even though we have been adding SF. it is a reduction based
        on square footage, of course. but of course it is showing a reduction every
        other area, water, waste, as well. and then carbon, we, this not what you
        are talking about with energy. but we are the first installation to ever reduce
        carbon footprint on base|post. so we know exactly what our carbon reduction
        is. but we also know exactly what our carbon consumption is. we have 182k
        square, 182k acres on base|post. about 130k of that is forestry. those all,
        all those trees eat up carbon. we did a  co-op with the STATE1 forestry commission,
        which was a year, a year analysis. we actually consume nearly 200% more carbon
        than we produce on base|post. that is good. and we can go back and pinpoint
        that we are doing a great job with our forestry management, environmental
        management, land management. we are really gearing in on planting of trees.
        last year we planted 35k trees, seedlings. and so all of that has an end result
        that we are actually eating up quite a bit more carbon than we are producing.
        so we eating it up for the region. so CITY1 is happy, and our entire region.
        anyway, I will give you the report. I got the report and it did go up to TOP_MANAGEMENT.
        they were not very pleased with it, I think. I heard some [third hand discussion],
        they were not pleased. they were very please with my effort. I was the first
        one to do it and I came up with the idea. I produced this beautiful, beautiful,
        twenty-six pages. I don''t think they are concerned with the amount of carbon
        consumption the installations have. they have an agenda and the agenda of
        the TOP_MANAGEMENT is to say, "ok, we are actually buying renewable energy
        because we need to start reducing our primary energy". to turn around and
        say, "ok, we eat up a lot of carbon, and are doing a lot of good here". that
        is not a part of their agenda. the agenda, not with, not with the TOP_AGENCY,
        but I think it is with the civilian side more. basically saying, it is not
        a part of our agenda to say that we are doing a good job with the forestry
        section. but the reality is that is how corporations look at it. corporations
        that produce a hundred tons of carbon. they go out and buy 500 acres and say
        we want to offset. this is important this offset. I don''t think the federal
        government really cares about showing that side because they do not want to.
        they want to zero in on PV. it does not help when we say that trees are a
        cheaper way of going than buying PV. again, that is just between you and I.
        we need to advertise that the OVERALL_MY_TOP_ORG is doing a fantastic job
        of land management. we have got endangered species that are prolific on PLACE1.
        and through out the US. and that is not by accident. it is because the TOP_MANAGEMENT
        knows what they are doing. we have 130k, something, acres of forestry that
        is eating up carbon, that is not by accident. they are doing a good thing.
        they need to get [the message] out there. that is not what they want to hear
        now. so I may end up dropping the carbon [part] next year. i think it is [a
        good perspective]. unfortunately I go off track on my corporate background
        and say "hey, there is good we are doing here". but they don''t want to hear

        tracking [what we are talking about]. so like LEED requirements and anything
        that has to do with energy efficiency in buildings. you know as a contract
        specialist, of course, I dealt with it as far as making sure the requirements
        were incorporated into the contracts. that we required at the time. so that
        part of it was basically more of making sure we had standards established
        in contracts. as a project manager, I deal with J2M0, in the ORG12, who is
        our LEED guru. and then, of course J3G0 and all of our folks there in the
        ORG12 that make sure we are tracking with the correct energy savings, and
        whatnot. not only the machines, the HVAC units put in, but the building construction
        itselves, J3G0 is the head of engineering division''s electrical and mechanical
        design review team. correct, he reviews on the project management side, exactly.
        a lot of times, what you guys submit to me, like for shop drawings, that need
        some additional reviews, or you just don''t have enough people to review mechanical
        or electrical. I will get that to J3G0 and he will disseminate that to his
        team and make sure that we are meeting certain energy criteria. at the same
        time, J3G0''s team does actual designs to meet energy criteria. so I coordinate
        a lot with J3G0 and with J2M0, to make sure that, one, I am meeting the energy
        criteria and then [two,] also as it applies to LEED. So I''m kind''of making
        sure I spearhead that effort. and making sure that also I''m complying with
        the latest engineering ECB. of, you know, what percentage we are suppose to
        meet for our buildings. for the last couple of years everybody had to meet
        30% energy savings while, there was also 40-50 percent that you could do as
        an option of contracts. while that has since gone away and just 30% is now
        the standard across the board that we put in all of the RFPs. of which, this
        year I have got two of the renovations for type BLDGCODE9 buildings have that
        directly written in the RFP. so it is not an option. so you just got to meet
        the 30% reduction. so; that is kind of my background. those two aspects and

        that increases the energy savings requirements. how are you planning on funding
        this new gap?\" and I remember she was on the stage and I think she could
        have fired one of those sharp shooting arrows. but [instead] she looked at
        me very nicely and said, \"we have not figured that out yet\". the truth of
        it is, she knows like everyone else in that room. is that if we cut the budget,
        that means we have got to cut scope of a project. you have got to cut training.
        you have got to cut maintainers, or service contracts. in order to meet that
        requirement. she did not want to say that, but what we all know [is that is

        items we may use. one example would be the waterless urinals that came out
        several years ago. one way to save water, let's use them. after a couple of

      block: ' translation of TOP_MANAGEMENT''s intent. going back, I guess it really
        traces its roots, if you look at it, from the presidential initiatives for,
        you know, meeting the yr-2020, yr-2030 one hundred percent [net zero goals].
        you know that, from my understanding was translated thru congress, into ORG35
        with our wonderful ECB bulletins. our engineering report bulletins. that come
        out, that are saying, ok, we must meet a thirty percent energy reduction by
        these dates. from what I was mentioning earlier about in yr-2010 or fy-10.
        that was when the first criteria came out that all requests for proposals
        will have within the RFP a thirty percent reduction in energy across the board.
        How ever that is achieved is up to the designer of record [as long as the
        criteria is met]. and then along with that in fy-11 and [fy-12] an option
        to include in all those RFPs was added to meet a forty percent reduction.
        now it was an option to all those contracts. the idea was that the contractor
        would propose on it and then during the technical evaluation of it. if it
        was cost worthy, I''m not sure if that is the correct word. cost effective,
        cost appropriated to pay this much more to achieve a forty percent energy
        reduction. would the customer pay it. now on construction projects, PROGRAM5,
        that option would go up thru higher, our channels, perhaps up to ORG35 and
        then the decision would be made. now for O&M funded projects that are originated
        funding thru the installation and FFLEET_MANAGEMENT. we go back to the ORG2
        and say, "hey, you know we can award this project it will have a thirty percent
        baseline energy reduction for this project." "however, if we paid this much
        more, we will achieve a forty percent [reduction]". and depending on what
        FFLEET_MANAGEMENT was willing to fund the installation to do that. and depending
        on what, I guess criteria they were looking to meet. they would fund it or
        not. thus far on all the type BLDGCODE9, every option that I had for additional
        energy savings was funded. now, this year, the first year that the forty percent
        and fifty percent have been eliminated. it is all just thirty percent across
        the board right now. there is no longer an option to meet forty, fifty percent.
        I believe it is because they went thru the analysis of it and it was not really
        cost effective. and more importantly it was not practical to test for. did
        you actually achieve forty percent energy reduction. that goes back to a whole
        another discussion about, well, are you metering. are you metering every part
        of these buildings. do you have a meter on every light system? do you have
        your water meter. do you have your gas consumption meter. where you can actually
        go back in two years after a project has been completed that was suppose to
        [have] a forty percent energy reduction. and actually test and go, "did it
        (met the goal)". and because the predominate answer was usually no (no testing
        for goal). because you don''t have metering setup like that, [then] why are
        we paying for it? and so now that baseline is just to put at a thirty percent
        energy reduction in there. and the designer of record is responsible to show
        how they are meeting that [reduction] as well as trying to set the parameters
        to meter [the energy usage]. so we can actually test for [the energy reduction]. '

        the TOP_AGENCY, and again. actually, the President (POTUS) then, because the
        President has executive orders you have to follow. and then the TOP_AGENCY,
        then TOP_MANAGEMENT, and then within FFLEET_MANAGEMENT. and the FFLEET_MANAGEMENT
        is the designator [of the] "owners" of all of the installations the in OVERALL_MY_TOP_ORG.
        but, again, they have to follow the dictates of, you know, Congress, President,
        etc., on down the line. so, so that gets you down to the, ok, how-do-we-deal-with-it-personally-at-this-installation
        level. now from my perspective, and from an TOP_MANAGEMENT regulation perspective,
        the senior CHIEF_EXECUTIVE, GO3M0, is the owner of everything on PLACE1. then
        by TOP_MANAGEMENT regulation, REGNUM1, he can delegate that authority down
        to the CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORG. so the CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORG becomes, kind of
        a mayor of PLACE1, in terms of who owns everything. we own, we "own" in parenthesis.
        we own all of the buildings. we own the natural, natural, natural infrastructure,
        and everything else that is on the installation. now, we obviously don''t
        own the end-users, those are [part of operational activities]. but, but, we
        are owners in terms of literally any of the infrastructure and anything else
        that is on here. now we share that ownership with other partners. for instance,
        ORG6. we privatized, privatized the water purification system. we privatized
        the waste water system. and so, ORG6 is now the one that is a partner in that,
        in that with us in terms of that infrastructure. we obviously pay them for
        that every year for their services. but, but we are partners in all that.
        the same thing does with, with the provision of electricity. ORG5 has a distribution
        system here on the installation. so we are partners in that. you know, we
        obviously have the controlling hand in saying this is what we need. but we
        have to pay for that to get [the need] filled. you know, the ORG41, we privatized
        all of our housing. so ORG41 is our partner in that. so you know, when you
        get to owners (ownership), we are, we are responsible for all of them, we
        have a controlling stake [in the process]. but we also are partnered with
        a lot of outside agencies. and that goes to, not only physical things here
        on the installation, but also services. we have got, we have got the bus lines

        the installation. ^/owner set policy/^ so, so you know that in terms of, ok,
        who is, who is the owner. and then the LOCAL_PROP_ORG delegates ownership
        responsibility for buildings to the various [groups] on the installation.
        so the ORG29 [building] is the largest, the next one is probably ORG42 hospital.
        and then the ORG10 education activities, that is the schools. then it is the
        smaller organizations. ORG44 is here. the TOP_SISTER_ORG2 is here. so, so,

        lot of money for, for maintenance of real property and those sorts of things".
        "and they, too, have been putting a lot of money into LOCAL_PROP_ORG facilities".
        ^/funding::budget management::unbalanced/s^ I said that if you come to a ORG20
        organization, you will find that because the PROGRAM11 account has historically
        underfunded. the senior CHIEF_EXECUTIVEs have taken money from the sustainment
        (repair and maintenance) accounts on the installations and put that into PROGRAM11
        accounts to make up the shortage. and he looked at me and said, "yeah". they
        did not need to do a study. all they needed to do is ask the CHIEF_LOCAL_PROP_ORGs
        any one of those three [types of] installations and they could tell you. so,
        so, the TOP_MANAGEMENT, the TOP_MANAGEMENT made a conscious decision to say
        we have to got to do a better job of this. and part of that to is that we
        just did our, our SPECIAL_EVENT1, you know, ceremonies and celebrations, and,
        and activities. it covered a full week here. and, you know, when I got back
        from COUNTRY2, that was still something to, that was going to happen. and
        so, I think the conscious, the American consciousness about the importance
        of the environment and the connectivity of the environment with all the other
        activities has really driven us to say. "hey, we, we really need to be good
        caretakers of the environment. and to do that we need to do, we need to be

        an idea and they came to me. and said, "hey, look would you be willing to

        three years we have worked on them to develop the wind turbine. well, what
        we know now is that it will save us about thirty-two percent of the energy
        required on the evaporator (actually means condenser) motor on an HVAC system.
        it is on big systems so the first one that we had is over on our, in our,
        testing yard. over on the simulation center. PLACE14, the simulation center.
        the simulation center has all these electronic simulations going on. so you
        have, you have EQUIPCODE2, you have EQUIPCODE3. you have the EQUIPCODE4, you
        have EQUIPCODE5 [equipment]. all those things, all in one building. so, there

        and said, "yay, good deal, you are saving money". so about a seven year return
        on investment. and we have seven more systems that are going to be in place
        by the end of july on the installation. and again, we had a team that went
        out and looked at, we had twenty-eight major HVAC system on the installation.
        we had them look at all of them to see which ones would give us best return
        on investment. and there is eight of them. so that is what we are putting
        them on. that is going to save us. it is a two hundred and ten thousand dollar
        investment. it is going to save us, start putting two hundred and ten thousand

        ^/cost savings::redirected to other needs/s^ that is small in terms of the

        fix a roof for that". I can fix another HVAC system, I can do all of those
        sorts of things. and so those are the, those are the sorts of small initiatives

        folks". and once you designated them, have them go to our website. put in
        the designated [person''s] name and that will trigger them that they now need
        to be notified that they need to take these courses. and they can do these
        courses on the web. ^/policy::compliance training/s^ it automatically, automatically

        know that, hey, I have still got a group that is out there that has, doesn''t
        have an environmental compliance officer that is trained, etc, etc. same with
        the building energy monitors, all that stuff. so that''s, so I think that
        has been a huge boon to us. to be able to use the technology, the information
        technology, to put that, all the training and the other things on the web
        for folks. as well as keep track of who is trained and who is not trained,

        back in yr-1997, yr-1999 time frame. and then I turned around and became the

        many of the things that we do in government agencies are directed by policy
        that has a political agenda attached to it. and so, I will give you a great
        example. we know on this installation that we could save literally millions
        of dollars in energy cost by shifting [away from] ethanol fuel. which is a
        mandate, a political mandate. to compressed natural gas. and so, we know that,
        so from a strictly how-do-I-conserve-my-resources [point of view]. we are
        pushing very hard to do that. but the GOV_SERVICE_AGENCY that provides our
        vehicles. the, the senior MNGMT that have to approve any of our decisions
        in that way, are following, you know, their guidelines. their political guidelines.
        that says, well, you have to use e-85 vehicles. you have to use ethanol. and
        from a, again from a macro perspective. and see, I don''t see it just as here
        is energy conservation. I have to look at the entire [spectrum] of what effects
        this installation. but right now, right now RIVER1 aquifers are drastically
        being drained. why? well because ethanol is made from corn. corn requires,
        around this area, requires that it to be irrigated. so the RIVER1 between
        here and CITY2, [those] that own farms that are irrigating along the RIVER1
        aquifers are literally draining the aquifers to raise corn to make ethanol.
        well, what effect does that have on us. it reduces overall the water flows
        that come down through this area. and anybody who has lived here for more
        than a year or two knows that there, you got a water war going on between
        STATE1, STATE3, [and STATE3]. actually between CITY2 and everybody downstream,
        ok. but it is also affected by the folks that, the farmers who are raising
        corn to meet an ethanol requirement, you know, for the government. and so,
        so, what does that do. well, it is destroying wetlands. wetlands are, are
        important to us for conservation of animals. it is reducing the water flow
        that we get down here. so, you know, I understand [that] on one side I am
        told that you got to use it (ethanol) in all your vehicles. on the other side,
        from a financial standpoint. from an environmental, ecological standpoint
        its a disaster to do that. but again, we have, we have to follow what our
        senior MNGMT dictates to us. this is one example of the political agendas
        we have to follow. '

        look I''m probably am not the right person to ask because I don''t have a
        lot of involvement before clients come to ORG51. I don''t know, let me give
        you an example I did a project for a waste water plant in STATE17 someplace.
        and they, they were putting in VFD motors for all the pumps, which was a great
        idea. they also replaced their, their. I having a little trouble. their, their
        air. their biological tank. I''m just drawing a blank. they went from a, they
        went a, a, from the conventional system, which is some kind of aerated tank.
        to a bio-film system, and they saved, and they saved a lot of energy doing
        it. so those were that. so one is the case, of it was strictly in their field,
        and they should be aware of it and they were. the other is a case where, you
        know, pretty much everyone knows about VFDs, drives, motors. and so they were
        a, just a. probably, I''m guessing, an outreach contractor went to them to
        say, "hey, why don''t you do this", because they probably were one of the
        top, say fifty energy users in the state. so it made sense to do that. so
        then I went to the site and I''m looking around and. there are lots of things
        they could have done in addition and it would have made a lot sense. like
        for example from their bio reactor, by their bio tanks they were getting all
        this bio fuels. you know, it is methane, essentially, but, but it is probably
        not a real clean methane. and they were flaring this off. and, you know, I
        don''t know if you know this but you can buy boilers, it would have to be
        a little different than a conventional boiler, but you can buy boilers that
        you can hook this gas up to [it] and burn it. and heat oil, heat water, you
        know, and do whatever you do with it. you can heat your buildings for example.
        and they are just burning this stuff everyday, you know. and so, "why don''t
        you guys do this project when ORG51 will probably give you fifty percent of
        the capital?" and they really were not interested at the time, at the time.
        and that kind of, I found that surprising because it seemed like a win-win

        save it at the cost of, you know, the reliability of the energy. and then

        building owner type group. ^/LEED::corporate advertising/s^  I know several,
        I can give you some examples where a LEED platinum is like "gold" for marketing.
        but they like it (the LEED program) as well because they seem to think, or
        know that a LEED platinum designation gives them a better quality building
        and happier tenants. so I think that is good. and I know that, like my wife

        then all of a sudden somebody gets bumped off. so there is just a little competition
        to get to the top. I think that is what their intent is, it is working then.

        degree in environmental. civil [engineering], environmental, structural, and,
        let''s see, I have covered a lot of areas. my primary, my area of research
        for my PhD was exposure to contaminants. mostly indoor, but I dealt with water-borne
        and other consumer products as well. so I did a lot of, a lot of interface
        work between environmental and human activities. and the physiology associated
        with all that. so it is a little bit complicated to explain, but it was pretty
        diverse to start with. and then I did a lot of computer modeling along with
        that. so that is really my area of expertise. then I have to say that my first
        degree was essentially in structures. and then I did a bunch of work before
        I went back to graduate school, in a, in, you know, building related issues.
        as well as, I guess what you would call basic civil engineering things, like
        water, water management, other utility management. runoff, you know, bridges
        and dams, not bridges so much as dams. a lot of development (property) type
        stuff. you know, parking lots, water management associated with development
        and then a lot of other infrastructure, sewer. all the standard civil engineering
        things [associated with property development]. then I went back to graduate
        school and I started. I actually worked in a lot of landfill work as well,
        which is sort of a cross, a cross between environmental and civil. then I
        went back to graduate school and then I studied air and soil stuff and then
        I developed models, and then I went to work for ORG49. so some of that is
        kind of my experience. ^/environmental engineering/s^ my first work at ORG49
        was all environmental. but anything I did had an energy component and I started
        doing a lot of work on buildings, back say around 2002. ^/mold remediation/s^
        I, I got into mold [remediation] business, and most of mold, most mold problems
        have to do either flaw in the building envelope or with the mechanical system
        in the building. depending on the location and things like that. so I got
        into air handlers and dehumidification issues and other other water related
        issues with building systems. and a lot of those had energy components with
        them. ^/EE skills/s^ so that is when I really started getting into it. so

        business model is to create a product, to be able to create that product.
        and if, if they do not create that product they go out of business. that is
        number one. ^/corporate::business model::second::cost efficiency/^ then number
        two is how much is it going to cost me to create that product. because the
        higher the cost, in this case it is everything (total cost of the product).
        but it could, you could look at this in isolation with the energy components.
        and obviously that is part of their total cost. and as that cost goes up they
        sell less of their product. or people buy less of the product because of market
        driven forces. so the bottom line is, businesses from my experience are about
        the same, they are in the business of making money. so obviously they are
        going to weight their decisions based on that. but having said that, you mentioned
        that there is a silo''ing effect in the private sector. I think Google is
        a perfect example of this. we have been to a couple of meetings where we have
        seen what they are doing. they are promoting certain types of technologies
        that they think are good for advertising. it is still a good business model,
        but I think that from a project, an individual project point of view, so of
        these don''t have great paybacks. and they could make more, they could save
        more money, or make more money, that is a different decision. but that is
        also a part of their [corporate] image and they are making their decision
        based on that, I think. '

        is my, the tradeoffs. the cost estimate, they are not capable of doing that,
        and probably they should not be. ^/owner::large public sector::EE manager
        role/s^ that is probably where the line is drawn. the guy that I spoke about
